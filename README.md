# Movie-Recommendation-System
A simple recommendation system to recommend movies from a CSV file.

We're importing data through a CSV file, converting the textual data into tokens , removing stop words, converting tokens into vectors, then using cosine similarity to get a list of similarities, then use a function to slice the list and get the list of highest recommended movies :)
