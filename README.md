# Movie-Recommendation-System
A content-based recommendation system trained from over 50,000 movies.

Steps included: 
- Importing data through a CSV file,
- Converting the textual data into tokens, 
- Removing stop words, converting tokens into vectors, 
- Using cosine similarity to get a list of similarities, 
- Then use a function to slice the list and get the list of highest recommended movies :)
